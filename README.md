# Wordle Solver

A high-performance Wordle solver and optimizer in Python, designed to minimize the average number of guesses required to solve any Wordle puzzle. This project uses algorithmic strategies, caching, and simulation to achieve an average of **3.4985 tries** per game.

## Overview
This project provides a solver for the popular game Wordle. It uses advanced strategies (like minimax entropy) and precomputed caches to efficiently guess the answer in as few tries as possible. The codebase also includes tools for optimizing the solver and evaluating its performance.

## How It Works
- **Feedback Calculation**: For each guess, the solver computes feedback (green/yellow/gray) as in Wordle, using an optimized and cached function.
- **Filtering**: After each guess, the set of possible answers is filtered based on the feedback.
- **Guess Selection**: The main strategy is minimax entropy, which chooses the guess that minimizes the expected size of the remaining answer pool.
- **Caching**: Expensive computations (like all possible feedback patterns) are precomputed and cached for fast solver startup and execution.

## Scripts
- **solver.py**: The core solver. Implements the main algorithm, feedback logic, answer filtering, and minimax entropy strategy. Can be run interactively or imported as a module.
- **optimize_cache.py**: Precomputes and caches feedback patterns, letter frequencies, and best first guesses. Run this once to generate cache files for optimal performance.
- **average_score_calculator.py**: Simulates games against all possible answers using the solverâ€™s strategy, and calculates the average number of tries. Outputs the result to `average_tries.txt`.
- **helper.py**: An interactive helper for narrowing down possible answers based on your guesses and feedback. Useful for manual play or as a Wordle assistant.

## Data Files
- **allowed_wordle_guesses.txt**: List of all valid guess words.
- **possible_wordle_answers.txt**: List of all possible answer words.
- **average_tries.txt**: Output file with the calculated average number of tries.
- **feedback_patterns_cache.pkl, letter_freq_cache.pkl, first_guesses_cache.pkl**: Binary cache files generated by `optimize_cache.py` for fast solver performance.

## Setup & Usage
1. **Requirements**
   - Python 3.7+
   - No external dependencies (uses only the Python standard library)

2. **Install**
   - (Optional) Create a virtual environment:
     ```bash
     python -m venv venv
     source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
     ```

3. **Precompute Caches** (Recommended for speed)
   ```bash
   python optimize_cache.py
   ```

4. **Run the Solver Interactively**
   ```bash
   python solver.py
   ```
   (Follow prompts to play or test the solver.)

5. **Calculate Average Tries**
   ```bash
   python average_score_calculator.py
   ```
   (Outputs the average to `average_tries.txt`.)

6. **Use the Helper**
   ```bash
   python helper.py
   ```
   (Interactive assistant for narrowing down answers based on your guesses and feedback.)

## Results
- **Average number of tries (minimax entropy strategy):**
  - **3.4985**
- This means the solver, on average, can solve any Wordle puzzle in under 3.5 guesses!
