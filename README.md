# Wordle Solver

A high-performance Wordle solver and optimizer in Python, designed to minimize the average number of guesses required to solve any Wordle puzzle. Now supports both standard and hard modes. This project uses algorithmic strategies, caching, and simulation to achieve an average of **3.4883 tries** per game in standard mode, and **3.6192 tries** in hard mode.

## Overview
This project provides a solver for the popular game Wordle. It uses advanced strategies (like minimax entropy) and precomputed caches to efficiently guess the answer in as few tries as possible. The codebase also includes tools for optimizing the solver and evaluating its performance. Both standard and hard modes are supported.

## How It Works
- **Feedback Calculation**: For each guess, the solver computes feedback (green/yellow/gray) as in Wordle, using an optimized and cached function.
- **Filtering**: After each guess, the set of possible answers is filtered based on the feedback.
- **Guess Selection**: The main strategy is minimax entropy, which chooses the guess that minimizes the expected size of the remaining answer pool.
- **Caching**: Expensive computations (like all possible feedback patterns) are precomputed and cached for fast solver startup and execution.

## Hard Mode
Hard mode enforces additional constraints on guesses:
- Any letter revealed as green must be reused in the same position in subsequent guesses.
- Any letter revealed as yellow must be reused in subsequent guesses, but not in the same position.
- Only guesses that satisfy all previous feedback are allowed.

The solver and all tools support hard mode, allowing you to simulate and analyze performance under these stricter rules.

## Scripts
- **solver.py**: The core solver for standard mode. Implements the main algorithm, feedback logic, answer filtering, and minimax entropy strategy. Can be run interactively or imported as a module.
- **solver_hard_mode.py**: The core solver for hard mode, enforcing Wordle's hard mode constraints.
- **optimize_cache.py**: Precomputes and caches feedback patterns, letter frequencies, and best first guesses for standard mode. Run this once to generate cache files for optimal performance.
- **optimize_cache_hard_mode.py**: Precomputes the best first guess for hard mode and saves it to a separate cache file.
- **average_score_calculator.py**: Simulates games against all possible answers using the standard solverâ€™s strategy, and calculates the average number of tries. Outputs the result to `average_tries.txt`.
- **average_score_calculator_hard_mode.py**: Simulates games in hard mode and outputs the average to `average_tries_hard_mode.txt`.
- **helper.py**: An interactive helper for narrowing down possible answers based on your guesses and feedback. Useful for manual play or as a Wordle assistant.

## Data Files
- **allowed_wordle_guesses.txt**: List of all valid guess words.
- **possible_wordle_answers.txt**: List of all possible answer words.
- **average_tries.txt**: Output file with the calculated average number of tries (standard mode).
- **average_tries_hard_mode.txt**: Output file with the calculated average number of tries (hard mode).
- **feedback_patterns_cache.pkl, letter_freq_cache.pkl, first_guesses_cache.pkl**: Binary cache files generated by `optimize_cache.py` for fast solver performance (standard mode).
- **first_guesses_cache_hard_mode.pkl**: Binary cache file generated by `optimize_cache_hard_mode.py` for hard mode performance.

## Setup & Usage
1. **Requirements**
   - Python 3.7+
   - No external dependencies (uses only the Python standard library)

2. **Install**
   - (Optional) Create a virtual environment:
     ```bash
     python -m venv venv
     source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
     ```

3. **Precompute Caches** (Recommended for speed)
   - For standard mode:
     ```bash
     python optimize_cache.py
     ```
   - For hard mode:
     ```bash
     python optimize_cache_hard_mode.py
     ```

4. **Run the Solver Interactively**
   - Standard mode:
     ```bash
     python solver.py
     ```
   - Hard mode:
     ```bash
     python solver_hard_mode.py
     ```
   (Follow prompts to play or test the solver.)

5. **Calculate Average Tries**
   - Standard mode:
     ```bash
     python average_score_calculator.py
     ```
     (Outputs the average to `average_tries.txt`.)
   - Hard mode:
     ```bash
     python average_score_calculator_hard_mode.py
     ```
     (Outputs the average to `average_tries_hard_mode.txt`.)

6. **Use the Helper**
   ```bash
   python helper.py
   ```
   (Interactive assistant for narrowing down answers based on your guesses and feedback.)

## Results
- **Average number of tries (minimax entropy strategy):**
  - **Standard mode:** 3.4883
  - **Hard mode:** 3.6192
- This means the solver, on average, can solve any Wordle puzzle in under 3.5 guesses in standard mode, and under 3.7 guesses in hard mode!
